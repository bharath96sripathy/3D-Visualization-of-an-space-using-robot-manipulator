•	An ultrasonic sensor is connected to the micro controller (ARDUINO).
•	Ultrasonic sensor is capable of sending and receiving sound waves. 
•	The sensor is made to rotate to measure distance at every angle.
•	The position of ultrasonic sensor is controlled by using 2 servo motors.
•	One motor is mounted vertically for the horizontal movement of the sensor.
•	Other motor is mounted horizontally on the shaft of the vertically mounted motor.
•	These two motors help the ultrasonic  sensor to move along x and y direction. 
•	The ‘Trig’ pin in the ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves.
•	The ‘Echo’ pin in the ultrasonic sensor receives the reflected wave from the object.
•	This data is transferred to the microcontroller (ARDUINO) through serial communication.
•	The control module (Arduino) sends the angle position of the motor, the processing module (Ultrasonic sensor) gives the distance of the object/obstacle.
•	Interfacing is done between the ‘Arduino’ and ‘Processing’ .
•	This enables serial communication in between ‘Arduino’ and ‘Processing’.
•	The serial data transferred to ‘Processing’ .
•	The data is visualized in 3 dimensions using ‘Processing’.
