# 3D-Visualization-of-an-space-using-robot-manipulator
Sonar is a technique that uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water. 
The project focuses on the development of a device capable of creating simple 3-dimensional view of a object using ultrasonic sensor.
The basic concept behind these technologies is that a wave of energy is sent out from a transmitter, reflects off of surfaces, and a receiver then picks up the reflected wave.
The distance between the sensor and the surface can be calculated based on the time difference between sending and receiving the wave.     
The objective of this project is to design and prototype a 3 dimensional visualizing device. 
It must contain a transmission system to communicate to a computer, which will generate the visualization.
